                                <p>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent
                                    or treat
                                    COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People
                                    with
                                    serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive
                                    care.
                                    Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They
                                    are being
                                    tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and
                                    medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself

                                    others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with

                                    of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people
                                    who are
                                    coughing or sneezing. </p>

                                <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone

                                    coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very
                                    low.
                                    However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                                    particularly true
                                    at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from
                                    someone
                                    who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing

                            <div class="content">
                                <p> No. Hantaviruses are not new and have been around for a while. For one, it is
                                    transmitted to
                                    people when they breathe in infected rodents' droppings, urine or saliva.

                                    The US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) states that the Hantavirus is a family of
                                    viruses
                                    spread mainly by rodents.

                                    The virus is inhaled and reaches the lungs where it wreaks havoc. It begins to
                                    invade tiny
                                    blood vessels called capillaries, eventually causing them to leak. The lungs then
                                    flood with
                                    fluid, which can trigger any of the respiratory problems associated with hantavirus
                                    pulmonary syndrome.</p>

                                    Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the

                                    they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than
                                    COVID-19.
                                    There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.</p>
