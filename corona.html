                            <a> What is Hantavirus? Is it as deadly as Coronavirus?</a>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p> No. Hantaviruses are not new and have been around for a while. For one, it is
                                    transmitted to
                                    people when they breathe in infected rodents' droppings, urine or saliva.

                                    The US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) states that the Hantavirus is a family of
                                    viruses
                                    spread mainly by rodents.

                                    The virus is inhaled and reaches the lungs where it wreaks havoc. It begins to
                                    invade tiny
                                    blood vessels called capillaries, eventually causing them to leak. The lungs then
                                    flood with
                                    fluid, which can trigger any of the respiratory problems associated with hantavirus
                                    pulmonary syndrome.</p>

                                    they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than
                                    COVID-19.
                                    There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.</p>

                                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                                    others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                                    between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes
                                    COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                                    Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals
                                    and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19
                                    is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                    respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of
                                    COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                                    always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.
                                    Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                                    going to the bathroom.

                                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                    that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                                    eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                    In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                                    is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped
                                    over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                <p>It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.
                                    Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather
                                    months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses
                                    during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19
                                    will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the
                                    transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and
                                    investigations are ongoing.

                                <p>CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are
                                    returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death,
                                    some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the
                                    local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based
                                    and aid organizations, and the deceasedâs employer. There likely will need to be an
                                    official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular
                                    office.

                                    CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been
                                    embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.

                                    At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States
                                    and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal
                                    Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into
                                    the United States only under the following conditions:

                                    The remains are cremated; OR
                                    The remains are properly embalmed and placed in a hermetically sealed casket; OR
                                    The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. The CDC permit
                                    (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment.
                                    Permits for the importation of the remains of a person known or suspected to have
                                    died from a quarantinable communicable disease may be obtained through the CDC

                                    If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or
