# Why Contribute

There is a lot happening across the globe but bringing all of them to a single platform is what is needed at the moment to ensure that we stay focused and still not miss on anything. But at the same time the data being reliable and understandable is a bigger concern. We plan on focusing on this core problem and building the solution so that nobody misses any information.
